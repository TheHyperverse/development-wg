## Decentology - working group

# Bounty Process 
### Draft - Nov. 9th 2021

### PURPOSE
This document is being used to define the lifecycle of a bounty, the actors involved and lightweight process to build upon.

### SCOPE
We are optimizing for speed and simplicity to encourage widespread adoption. The initial funding for the bounty program may be in the range of $500k tbc. The process defined here is to be iterated upon as we gain experience and feedback from stakeholders and contributors.

### OVERVIEW
To accelerate development of the hyperverse a bounty program will be developed to incentivize community contributions.


### ACTORS/STAKEHOLDERS
**Sponsor** - Who wants the bounty completed and is willing to pay for that? Projects, protocols and companies that may sponsor bounties. 

**Proposal Approver(s)** - Bounty committee assures Sponsor request is aligned with the health and wellbeing of the Decentology community and enhances the hyperverser. 

**Product Management** -Breakdown requests into bounties with defined specifications, rewards, and timelines.

**Hunter(s)** - Individuals or teams that work to satisfy the bounty. Anybody may claim a bounty and contribute work-product that satisfies the bounty requirements to claim a reward.

**Work Product QA/Approver** - The bounty Approver / Product Management / Engineering (??)

**Award Issuer (Proposal Approver?)** - Decentology treasury/multi-sig

### STANDARDIZE COMMUNICATION 

#### Request Templates
Template(s) for sponsors proposing a bounty program
- Title
- Program Scope
- Timing
- Approval
- Budget

Template(s) for product management to turn program into specific bounty posts 
- Title
- Skills
- Bounty Task Scope
- Timing
- Approval
- Budget

### Time Cadence
Ad hoc to start. As Sponsors programs are confirmed by Decentology product management will breakdown work to align with roadmap and goals. This is a potential bottleneck that should be monitored. 

Weekly check-in with hunters. (a la ETH Global hackathon check-ins?)

Payout schedule on acceptance or defined times eg 1st & 15th

### RISKS, OPEN ISSUES AND QUESTIONS
Size of bounty tasks has to be big enough to justify process overhead.

How many actors in the process to start? We could collapse a few of these roles down eg 
Product managers could be sole QA? 

### NOTES - remove when no longer relevant 
Research and option for bounty program by end of month - with 10 or so bounties to try in Dec and into the new year.

Early draft by Friday 12th

Observation: most bounty programs are pull request driven

We don't want all or nothing, if people make progress on a module they will get some type of credit

Bounty more well defined and smaller
vs
Grant will be larger and team oriented - out of scope for now

No 'build it and they will come' - driven by customer need - from other blockchain projects - smart modules
