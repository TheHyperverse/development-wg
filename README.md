# Hyperverse Planning Committee

The Hyperverse Planning Committee is a group dedicated to architecting, developing, and discussing the future of the Hyperverse. The Hyperverse, in it's final form, will be a network of composable modules (featuring composable smart contracts) that will range across blockchains and will be a major component of a DAO. The Hyperverse truly aims to be the biggest decentralized network of composable smart contracts in all of Web3.

## Where to Find Us

You can find our main communication channel in the [Decentology Discord](https://discord.gg/decentology) under the Hyperverse/#planning-committee text channel.

## Top Priority Right Now

Referencing the notes from the previous meeting:

*The main goal with the Hyperverse Module Spec is to create a system of requirements (or even opt-in fields) that developers should include in their module submissions to the Hyperverse. This will allow discoverability of composable modules on a front-end in the future, allow developers to read documentation on the modules, read Ethereum-like contract ABIs to easily figure out how to interact with the contracts, etc. Additionally it will hopefully provide a way for developers to figure out how to easily include these composable smart contracts in their own DApps. It will also cover how to submit/register your own composable modules, what the review process will be like, etc in the future.*

@hhTheSpark proposed that we split up into a few teams to discuss smaller topics before bringing it to the group. As said in the meeting, our top priority is the Hyperverse Module Spec, specifically three things:
    
    a. Code Requirements
    b. Metadata Requirements
    c. Documentation Requirements

Let's discuss in the Discord who would like to be a part of each category (you can be a part of any/all) so we can get the ball rolling. Remember: your input is just as valuable as mine. The goal here is to start thinking/developing these ideas and bring them to the larger group sometime in the next week.
