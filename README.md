# Hyperverse Planning Committee

Latest Meeting: https://github.com/TheHyperverse/planning-committee/blob/main/meetingNotes/2021-09-07.md

## Top Priority Right Now

Referencing the notes from the previous meeting:

*The main goal with the Hyperverse Module Spec is to create a system of requirements (or even opt-in fields) that developers should include in their module submissions to the Hyperverse. This will allow discoverability of composable modules on a front-end in the future, allow developers to read documentation on the modules, read Ethereum-like contract ABIs to easily figure out how to interact with the contracts, etc. Additionally it will hopefully provide a way for developers to figure out how to easily include these composable smart contracts in their own DApps. It will also cover how to submit/register your own composable modules, what the review process will be like, etc in the future.*

@hhTheSpark proposed that we split up into a few teams to discuss smaller topics before bringing it to the group. As said in the meeting, our top priority is the Hyperverse Module Spec, specifically three things:
    
    a. Code Requirements
    b. Metadata Requirements
    c. Documentation Requirements

Let's discuss in the Discord who would like to be a part of each category (you can be a part of any/all) so we can get the ball rolling. Remember: your input is just as valuable as mine. The goal here is to start thinking/developing these ideas and bring them to the larger group sometime in the next week.
