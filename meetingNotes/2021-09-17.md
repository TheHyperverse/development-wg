## Attendees

Kevin McDonald, Jacob Tucker, Caos, AlexZ, Morgan Wilde, Nik Kalyani, bz, Phill, Angelica Turla, Hui Huang, Servais Bonazebi, skyone, Edward Tuck

## Agenda Items

- Contract metadata spec

## Decisions

- bz: It may be benefitial to add a "license" field to metadata
- Hui: Have a metadata schema that people can contribute to
- Caos: Change the UInt64 type of the `publishedAt` field to a UFix64 because of the `getCurrentBlock().timestamp` type. Absolute time... maybe better to keep UInt64
- Nik: Have really good docs on this stuff :D
- Hui: Draw inspiration from App Store submission
- Nik: Reputation has score? Individual reputation per author, leads to faster review/audit time?

## Next Steps

- Continue thinking through on-chain metadata
- How are we hosting the external metadata?
- What will the standard/expectation be for that external metadata?
