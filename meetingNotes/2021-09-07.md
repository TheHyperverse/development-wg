## Next Steps

Our main focus will be trying to figure out the Hyperverse Module Spec. Please refer to the google document linked above. We will focus on the first three parts of the spec:
1) Code requirements
2) Documentation requirements
3) Metadata requirements

The main goal with the Hyperverse Module Spec is to create a system of requirements (or even opt-in fields) that developers should include in their module submissions to the Hyperverse. This will allow discoverability of composable modules on a front-end in the future, allow developers to read documentation on the modules, read Ethereum-like contract ABIs to easily figure out how to interact with the contracts, etc. Additionally it will hopefully provide a way for developers to figure out how to easily include these composable smart contracts in their own DApps. It will also cover how to submit/register your own composable modules, what the review process will be like, etc in the future.
