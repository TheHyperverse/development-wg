# Tenant

A discussion on *Tenant* architecture whithin the context of a real world module – a fungible token module. This was live streamed on the [Decentology YouTube channel][0]

Differentiating between different Tenants of the same module with an `id` check.

Examples to explain module patterns.

1. Self-contained module with one .cdc file as a primary export, no other files.
  - (done) Fungible token.
2. A collection of constituent contracts and a single orchestrating contract as a primary export.
  - (later)
3. A single primary export contract .cdc, plus a single secondary export contract .cdc.
  - (doing) An NFT (secondary) + Markeplace (primary).
4. A single primary export contract .cdc, a single secondary export contract .cdc, and a single non-exported .cdc.
  - (later)

Import/Export for Solidity is something we need to understand better before making final suggestions on Hyperverse modules structure.

Using comments to markup imports as coming from an address, as opposed to coming from a source file.

# Next Meeting

We will implement a module example #3 – an NFT + marketplace combo module. Also, explore Solidity import mechanics.
