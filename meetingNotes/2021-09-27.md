# Module

A review of how to define a **Hyperverse Module**. This was live streamed on
the [Decentology YouTube][0] channel.

## License

This field was suggested during the previous planning committee. A concern if
we do provide this field would be what's the license for. Is it the underlying
source code, or the utility you gain from using the Module?

If we do inclue *license* then we could simply provide a choosealicense.com
type selector where you choose one license from a group of 3.

## Reviews

Modules should be reviewed by more than one person. And if that's the case,
then we need to keep track of a `[Review]` array. How those reviews affect a
module if up for debate.

```cadence
pub struct ModuleMetadata {
  // Title is used for search and as part of the unique Module identifier.
  pub var title: String

  // Version will user SemVer to describe Module version.
  pub var authors: [Author]

  // Unix timestamp with millisecond precision.
  pub var publishedAt: UInt64

  // Anything and everything that's not required for Hyperverse's on-chain
  // functionality.
  pub var external: String

  // In almost all cases this will be nil, but in the rare case where you don't
  // want to publishe a brand new module, you can publish secondaryModules by
  // populating this array with "Secondary.cdc" type contract files.
  pub var secondaryModules: [String]?

  // The unique location of where this Module will store it's Tenant.
  // This will allow third parties to interact with Module Tenants.
  // Perhaps in the format of a reverse domain name notation, just like the
  // Apple's App Bundle Identifier.
  //
  // If there are secondary modules, then the primary module orchestrates them
  // in the primary module code.
  pub var TenantStoragePath: StoragePath
}
```

```cadence
pub struct Author {
  // Chain-native address uniquely identifying this developer.
  pub var address: Address

  // URL to chain-non-specific collection of completely optional Author
  // metadata.
  //
  // This metadata will be encoded as JSON, with any number of optional fields
  // such as: name, twitter handle, etc.
  //
  // The Hyperverse Module Index will cache this external metadata and will
  // include it in the search algorithm.
  pub var external: String
}
```

# Tenant

Each Hyperverse Module will define a `Tenant` resource that implements the
`Tenant` interface, but also holds any data that's required by the Module
uniquely.

# Next Meeting

We will implement a *Fungible Token* module with a Tenant to deploy and test
this logic.
